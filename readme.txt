Simple Bouncing Ball program for DOSBox.

Requirements:
	- DOSBox
	- DMC compiler
	- DMC compiler DOS addons

Instructions: 
	1) Run make.bat
	2) Place main.exe into the DOSBox program folder
	3) Run DOSBox
	4) Run program through DOSBox

Rationale:
	I made the program just to play around with VGA mode. Should also serve as a good example.
	It was a great exercise; I had to read documentation for the DMC compiler, I had to learn about VGA mode, 
	and I had to do a lot of debugging.
